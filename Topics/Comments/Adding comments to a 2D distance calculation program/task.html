<h2>Adding comments to a 2D distance calculation program</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>You have encountered a program that calculates the distance between two points on a 2D surface, but it is completely uncommented and therefore hard to understand. Your task is to add comments to the program to improve its readability. The first line of the input contains two integers, x1 and y1 which is the first point. The second line of the input contains two more integers, x2 and y2 which is the second point. Output the program with the added comments.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1 2<br>3 4</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">// Taking inputs for first point<br>int x1 = 1;<br>int y1 = 2;<br><br>// Taking inputs for second point<br>int x2 = 3;<br>int y2 = 4;<br><br>// Calculating distance<br>double distance = Math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1));<br><br>// Printing the distance<br>System.out.println(distance);</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5 6<br>8 9</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">// Taking inputs for first point<br>int x1 = 5;<br>int y1 = 6;<br><br>// Taking inputs for second point<br>int x2 = 8;<br>int y2 = 9;<br><br>// Calculating distance<br>double distance = Math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1));<br><br>// Printing the distance<br>System.out.println(distance);</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
