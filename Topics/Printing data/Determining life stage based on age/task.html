<div class="step-text">
<p>Your task is to write a complete Java program that takes in a single line with an integer between 0-100 (inclusive) as input. This integer represents a person's age. The program should then print a message that tells the person which life stage they are in based on the following conditions: If the person's age is less than 13, print 'Child'; If the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), print 'Teenager'. If the age is between 20 and 59 (inclusive), print 'Adult'. Lastly, if the person's age is 60 or above, print 'Senior Citizen'.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">12<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Child<br></code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">16<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Teenager<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
